# AlgaeApp
This Shiny app shows the locations of snow algae samples that have been collected (by myself and others) as a part of my thesis project. The aim of this project is to compare observations of concentrations and cell density between differing apparent snow colors (red, green, and algae-free) and geographic locations. I used the Covid-19 Tracker Shiny app code as a frame of reference for this app. Link to the Covid-19 Tracker repo: https://github.com/eparker12/nCoV_tracker.
